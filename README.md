# This version of the Hytale ARM patch tried creating the dll netty_quiche42_aarch_64.dll. Created a version of netty_quiche42_aarch_64.dll several times but never of Netty version 4.2. Compiling Netty 4.2 requires Java 8, a version of Java never ported to Windows on ARM. Here is where I give up on this concept patch.
